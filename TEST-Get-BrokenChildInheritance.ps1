.DESCRIPTION
Recurse through a directory structure and for the directories where inheritance is broken and get the ACL details.

This script will produce inaccurate results if you do not have access to all directories and sub directories. 

Running SubInAcl may be required.

.PARAMETER <RootPath>

.INPUTS
 None. This script does not accept pipeline input. 

.EXAMPLE
./Get-BrokenChildInheritance.ps1 -RootPath 'C:\Test Source' -Verbose

This will recurse through the sub directories within the C:\Test Source directory. Use the -Verbose switch to output details about what the script is currently doing.
